A significant part of Coca-Cola’s success is its emphasis on brand 
over product. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells 
“happiness” in a bottle. With thousands of different products and 
packaging designs that vary among regions, a global marketing plan 
focused on the products themselves would be challenging to manage. 
Instead, Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle 
associated with its brand.
